<P>An IoT ecosystem consists of web-enabled smart devices that use embedded systems including processors, sensors, and communication
 hardware to capture, transmit, and act on data that they obtain from their environments. IoT devices share the sensor data obtained
 by connecting to an IoT gateway or other edge node where data is either transmitted to the cloud for analysis or analyzed locally.
 These devices often interact with other similar devices and act on the knowledge that they receive from each other. Much of the
 research is performed without human interference by the computers, although people may communicate with the devices â€” for example,
 set them up, send them instructions or access data.
The connectivity, networking, and communication protocols used with these web-enabled devices depend largely on the specific IoT applications used.

In addition, IoT can use artificial intelligence (AI ) and machine learning to help facilitate and dynamic data collection processes.</p>
