       `          <p>The internet of things gives companies several benefits. Some of the benefits are specific to industry, and some are applicable across multiple industries. Some of IoT's may benefits require undertakings to:</p>
       `` <ul>
            <li>Monitor its business processes as a whole;</li>
            <li>Better Customer Experience (CX);</li>
            <li>Save the money and the time;</li>
            <li>Improves productivity for employees;</li>
            <li>Integrating operating models and modifying them;</li>
            <li>Enable company choices better; and</li>

			</ul>
            <p>IoT allows organizations to reconsider how they conduct their markets and provide them with the resources they need to strengthen their business strategies.
            In general, IoT is the most abundant in manufacturing , transportation and utility organizations, making use of sensors and other IoT devices; however, it has also found use cases for organizations in the agriculture, infrastructure and home automation sectors, moving some organizations towards digital transformation.
            IoT can help agricultural farmers by making their work easier. Sensors can collect data on rainfall, humidity , temperature and soil content, as well as other factors that would help to automate agricultural techniques.
            Another factor that IoT can help with is the ability to monitor operations surrounding infrastructure. For example, sensors could be used to monitor events or changes taking place within structural buildings , bridges and other infrastructure. This brings benefits, such as cost savings, time savings, improvements in the efficiency of the workflow and paperless workflow.
            A home automation company may use IoT to control and manage in-build mechanical and electrical systems. Smart cities will help people reduce waste and energy use on a broader scale.
            IoT covers every industry, including healthcare, banking , retail and manufacturing businesses.</p>
