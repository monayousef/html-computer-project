<p>The internet of things helps people to live and work smarter, and to gain full control over their lives. IoT is important for 
business as well as providing smart devices to automate homes. IoT provides companies with a real-time look at how their systems 
really work, providing insights into everything from machine performance to supply chain operations and logistics operations.

IoT helps businesses to simplify operations and increased labor costs. This also reduces waste and increases service quality ,
 making production and distribution of goods less costly, as well as providing consistency in consumer transaction.
As such, IoT is one of the most important innovations in everyday life and it will continue to pick up momentum as 
more businesses understand the ability of connected devices to keep them competitive.</p>
